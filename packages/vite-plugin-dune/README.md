# Vite plugin for OCaml

A plugin for vite that handles `.ml` files compiled with `dune` and `js_of_ocaml`.

> [!WARNING]
> The development server might flash an error temporarily while the `.bc.js`
> file is missing during hot module replacement. This is due to a race with
> Dune that Iâ€™ve not yet been able to fix.
