## Abstract

Minimal implementations for dependent type checking and elaboration

## Notes

[@brendanzab](https://github.com/brendanzab):

This is an excellent resource demonstrating how to implement normalisation-by-evaluation,
bidirectional typing, dependent type checking, and elaboration in small, self-contained examples.

I found it invaluable in learning various approaches to implementing programming languages,
and it partly inspired me to create my own repository of programming language implementations[^1].
