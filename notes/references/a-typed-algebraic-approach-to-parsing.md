- **Abstract**:
  > In this paper, we recall the definition of the **context-free expressions**
  > (or µ-regular expressions), an algebraic presentation of the context-free
  > languages. Then, we define a core type system for the context-free
  > expressions which gives a compositional criterion for identifying those
  > context-free expressions which can be parsed unambiguously by predictive
  > algorithms in the style of recursive descent or LL(1).
  >
  > Next, we show how these typed grammar expressions can be used to derive a
  > parser combinator library which both guarantees linear-time parsing with no
  > backtracking and single-token lookahead, and which respects the natural
  > denotational semantics of context-free expressions. Finally, we show how to
  > exploit the type information to write a staged version of this library,
  > which produces dramatic increases in performance, even outperforming code
  > generated by the standard parser generator tool ocamlyacc.
